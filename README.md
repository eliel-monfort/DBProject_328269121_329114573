# 🏁 Stage 1

## 📘 Introduction

This project is a database for the **logistics unit of the Armored Corps**.

The system helps manage everything related to military gear, armored vehicles, soldiers, commanders, missions, and vehicle maintenance.

It keeps important information and makes it easy to track things like:

- What equipment is stored in each warehouse  
- Which soldier or unit is using which equipment  
- Armored vehicles and their maintenance records  
- Soldiers and commanders, and which units they belong to  
- Missions and which soldiers and units are taking part  

The goal is to create a clear and well-organized database that helps support real military tasks and gives accurate, up-to-date information for making decisions.

## 🧠 Design Decisions

While designing the database, we made a few key choices to keep it efficient, flexible, and accurate.

### 🔷 1. Inheritance – `Personnel` Table

We have two kinds of people in the system:

- **Commanders**
- **Soldiers**

Since they share some basic details like name, ID, phone number, rank, and unit, we made one main table called `Personnel` to store this shared info.

Then, we created two separate tables – `Commander` and `Soldier` – that use the `personnel_id` from the main table and add fields specific to each role (like training type for soldiers).

> 🧠 **Why it's good:** It avoids repeating the same data and makes it easy to search for any person in the system.

### 🔷 2. Weak Entity – `Vehicle_Part` Table

The `Vehicle_Part` table stores parts that belong to armored vehicles.

- There are identical parts that are belong to different vehicles.
- Each part is linked to just one vehicle.
- A part can't exist on its own – it must be connected to a vehicle.

So we made it a weak entity and gave it a combined primary key:
```sql
PRIMARY KEY (vehicle_id, part_id)
```

> 🧠 **Why it's good:** It clearly shows which part belongs to which vehicle and keeps the link strong between them.

### 🔷 3. Many-to-Many with Extra Info

Some many-to-many relationships in our system need more than just a link – they need extra details.

#### A. `Soldier_Mission_Assignment`

This table connects soldiers to their missions, and includes extra info like:

- When they joined
- What their role was
- Their status during the mission

#### B. `Problem_With`

This one connects vehicle parts to maintenance jobs that found problems with them, and includes:

- Repair cost
- Issue details
- Replacement date

> 🧠 **Why it's good:** These tables keep a full history of what happened, not just who is linked to what.

### 🔷 4. Normalization

We fully normalized the database to higher normal forms:

- Each type of data is in its own table with a clear primary key.
- Connections between tables use foreign keys.
- There’s no repeated data.
- It’s easy to scale or change the structure later.

For example:

- `Equipment_Use` stores when a soldier uses a piece of equipment, without repeating the name.
- `Commander_Unit_Assignment` tracks which commander was assigned to which unit, and when.

> 🧠 **Why it's good:** The system is clean, fast, and easy to update in the future.

# 📥 Data Insertion Methods

## Method 1: Mockaroo Data Generation

We used [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com) to generate realistic mock data for the following tables:

- `Warehouse`
- `Mission`
- `Personnel`
- `Equipment Type`
- `Maintenance`

The generated data was downloaded as CSV files and then imported using PostgreSQL import tools.

### 📸 Screenshot of Mockaroo configurations:

- **Mission Dield Definitions**

- **Personnel Field Definitions**

- **Equipment Type Field Definitions**

- **Maintenance Field Definitions**
![Mockaroo Config](Stage_1/MockarooFiles/Images/Maintenance_Field_Definition.png)

Mockaroo is a helpful tool that lets you quickly create large amounts of fake but realistic data, based on the structure you define for each field.  
We used it to build our initial dataset fast and with good accuracy, especially for big tables like `Warehouse` and `Mission`.

## Method 2: CSV File Insertion

We asked ChatGPT to generate 5 realistic CSV files with 500 rows each for the following tables:

- `Armored Vehicle`
- `Commander`
- `Soldier`
- `Unit`
- `Vehicle Part`

The CSV files were manually reviewed and then inserted into the database using PostgreSQL's CSV import functionality.

The video shows how we added data to the `Armored Vehicle` table using a CSV file. 
This method made it easy to insert a lot of data at once and worked well for large tables that follow a specific format.

Using CSV files helped us save time and avoid mistakes compared to typing the data manually.
The video also helps explain the process clearly and makes it easier to repeat if needed.

## Method 3: Python Script

For the third method, we used a Python script with `pandas` and `psycopg2` to insert data into the following tables automatically:
- `Equipment`
- `Problem With`
- `Soldier Equipment Use`
- `Soldier Mission Assignment`
- `Undergoes`
- `Unit Mission Assignment`
- `Vehicle Mission Assignment`

The script made data entry easier by letting us insert data into multiple tables automatically.  
This was especially useful for large datasets or when we needed to update the database regularly.  
It reads data from sources like CSV files, processes it, and runs SQL commands to add the data to the database.

## ✅ Summary

| Method   | Tables Covered                   | Status     |
|----------|----------------------------------|------------|
| Mockaroo | Warehouse, Mission, Personnel, Equipment Type, Maintenance | ✅ Completed |
| CSV      | Armored Vehicle, Commander, Soldier, Unit, Vehicle Part | ✅ Completed |
| Python   | Equipment, Problem With, Soldier Equipment Use, Soldier Mission Assignment, Undergoes, Unit Mission Assignment, Vehicle Mission Assignment | ✅ Completed |

## 💾 Backup
### 📽 Video of Backup implementation demo:

The video shows how we created and restored backups to keep our data safe and easy to recover.  
We used PostgreSQL’s built-in tools for this. Regular backups are important in case something goes wrong.  
They help make sure the data stays safe and doesn't get lost.

Backups also helped us work on the project as a team.  
By using the backup file, we could work on different parts without messing up each other's work.
